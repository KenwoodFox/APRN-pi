APRN-Pi Docs
==============

The APRN-Pi is a raspberry pi hat I designed to create an easy to use 2M interface
for a few other projects I'd been working on.

The original idea came from the hams at ``#hamradio`` on `Libera Chat <https://libera.chat/>`_, and
other helpful information came from w6ipa's work with his `PIRIM <https://www.tindie.com/products/w6ipa/radio-interface-module-pirim-for-raspberry-pi/>`_ 
as well as the `SHARI <https://hamprojects.info/shari/>` board, and I could not have made this without
help from all of them and my elmer.

These docs should be a quick reference but since I may use the APRN-Pi in multiple different projects
its safe to say that some expansion will be needed!
